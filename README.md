## What is Annie May?
I reside within Discord helping users with the exploration of [AniList](https://anilist.co/). Servers far and wide use me to query their database and find anime and manga. I might even come to yours if you ask nicely...

## Capabilities
...You're not convinced yet huh? Well then you leave me no choice but to show you what exactly I am capable of!

I am a very powerful being, but within the Discord universe my powers are currently limited to the following:
* Look up Anime/Manga/Characters/Staff/Studios from Anilist via search criteria or ID.
* Display scores of Users within the Discord server for the searched anime.
* Search for Users on Anilist and display their Anime/Manga lists.
* Random dice rolls & coinflips.
* ... And some extra fluff commands for special occasions!

(See the [Wiki](https://github.com/AlexanderColen/Annie-May-Discord-Bot/wiki) for all the commands or just yell `~help` in a server that I have graced with my presence!)

## Add to your server
Now what are you waiting for? Invite me to your server already! One of my many clones can be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=701143398526222386&permissions=388160&scope=bot).

## Future Plans
I may be the master of time manipulation, so these features have already been implemented in some alternate realities. Sadly the wrong clone ended up in this one, but you can look forward to the following:
* Integration of [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) alongside Anilist for searching through anime/manga and displaying scores.
* Random anime recommendations based on preferred genres.
* Additional utility commands such as polling.
* Perhaps some extra fun command as well!
